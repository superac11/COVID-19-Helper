# COVID-19-Helper
Project
 

The purpose of the project is to build an application, that will assist and inform residents in Maryland during the coronavirus pandemic. Our app COVID-19 Info will do just that.  
Features: 
COVID-19 info has a self-check feature, a stats feature, a resource feature, FAQ feature, and the community feature. The self-check feature will allow the user to input their health status/symptoms and the app will notify the user whether they should seek medical help or not. The stats feature will give users the ability sees detailed information on the number of infected people in their community, as well as the nation. This will help the user stay aware of the current situation and the status of it. The resource feature allows the users to view medical facilities within the Maryland region, in alphabetical order. The FAQ feature allow users to view Frequently asked questions, regarding the pandemic, as well as the CDC answers and responses to those questions. The community feature will allow previous and current COVID patients to share their experience. This will help Marylanders to emerge from this crisis more united and stronger. 
 

The application will be available on devices running Android 5.0 or above. 
All data and information are retrieved from the CDC and Johns Hopkins website.
